Boilderplate-php-REST-API
=========================

A starter Boilerplate php REST API that makes use of the Slim Framework and Monolog.  Includes dev/stage/prod settings and a database connection.

This example is not using Composer so it includes the Slim Framework v 2.4 and Monolog that it was built using.  

It took me a while (and a few APIs I built) to come to something that resembled something consistent and useful as far as an API base.  Please use, modify, distribute, or contribute to this as much as you like.
